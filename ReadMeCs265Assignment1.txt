strtoint(char *str)

The string can be entered in the following formats: 42, 42_10, 052_8, 0x2a_16.

The function first extracts the base from the input string by searching for an underscore character. It then converts the number part of the string to an integer using the extracted base.

The function starts by initializing the base to 10 and a pointer to the input string. It then searches for an underscore character in the input string. If an underscore is found, the function extracts the base from the input string and updates the base variable accordingly. The function then extracts the number part of the input string and converts it to an integer using the extracted base.

The function uses two while loops to extract the base and the number from the input string. The first while loop searches for an underscore character in the input string. If an underscore is found, the function extracts the base from the input string and updates the base variable accordingly. The function then uses a second while loop to extract the number part of the input string and convert it to an integer using the extracted base.

The function uses conditional statements to check if the characters in the input string are valid. If a character is not valid, the function returns 0 to indicate that the conversion has failed.

The strtoint function can be used in C programs to convert strings to integers in different bases. The function is useful for parsing user input in different formats and converting it to integers for further processing.

To use the strtoint function, you need to include the function definition in your C program and call the function with a string argument. The function returns an integer that you can use in your program.
